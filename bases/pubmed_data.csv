"background: an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has led to 95<U+2008>333 confirmed cases as of march 5  2020. understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. combining a mathematical model of severe sars-cov-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside wuhan  we estimated how transmission in wuhan varied between december  2019  and february  2020. we used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside wuhan if cases were introduced.methods: we combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in wuhan and international cases that originated in wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during january  2020  and february  2020. based on these estimates  we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. to estimate the early dynamics of transmission in wuhan  we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in wuhan and internationally exported cases from wuhan. the four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof)  by date of onset  as of jan 26  2020; daily number of new cases in wuhan with no market exposure  by date of onset  between dec 1  2019  and jan 1  2020; daily number of new cases in china  by date of onset  between dec 29  2019  and jan 23  2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between jan 29  2020  and feb 4  2020. we used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to wuhan (ie  top 20 most at-risk countries)  by date of confirmation  as of feb 10  2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in wuhan between jan 16  2020  and feb 11  2020.interpretation: our results show that covid-19 transmission probably declined in wuhan during late january  2020  coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. as more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to wuhan before these control measures  it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially  but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.funding: wellcome trust  health data research uk  bill &amp; melinda gates foundation  and national institute for health research."	2020	3	15	2020-03-15	"UK"	"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene &amp"	FALSE	FALSE

"there is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). the virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in wuhan  hubei province  china in december 2019. there have been around 96 000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05 03 2020). the disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. the symptoms are usually fever  cough  sore throat  breathlessness  fatigue  malaise among others. the disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities)  it may progress to pneumonia  acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and multi organ dysfunction. many people are asymptomatic. the case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. common laboratory findings include normal  low white cell counts with elevated c-reactive protein (crp). the computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. the virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov)  but has lower fatality. the global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain."	2020	3	14	2020-03-14	"India"	"Department of Pediatrics and Infectious Disease, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute, Mumbai, India. tanusinghal@yahoo.com."

"background: there's an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) infection since december 2019  first in china  and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till march 2  2020. identification  isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers  preventing transmission amplification events. the rt-pcr detection of viral nucleic acid test (nat) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic  just as in this covid-19 outbreak.methods: 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with covid-19 patients in hospital in wuhan  china  were tested for sars-cov-2 infection by use of quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) on samples from the respiratory tract. positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages.results: the positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. however  57% was positive among the specimens from the fever clinics. binary logistic regression analysis showed that age  not gender  was the risk factor for sars-cov-2 infection in fever clinics.conclusions: therefore  we concluded that viral nat played an important role in identifying sars-cov-2 infection."	2020	3	12	2020-03-12	"China"	"Dept.

"currently  the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as: sars-cov-2  covid-2019  or 2019-ncov) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. the previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses  such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) in 2003  and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus (mers-cov) in 2012  prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus sars-cov-2. the most promising compound is remdesivir (gs-5734)  a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating ebola virus infections. remdesivir inhibited the replication of sars-cov and mers-cov in tissue cultures  and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. in addition  a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) protease inhibitors  lopinavir ritonavir  and interferon beta (lpv rtv-infb) were shown to be effective in patients infected with sars-cov. lpv rtv-infb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with mers-cov. remarkably  the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of lpv rtv-infb against mers-cov in a transgenic humanized mice model. the relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections  sars-cov  mers-cov  and sars-cov-2  has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. it remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. this minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that showed potential in fighting sars-cov-2 infections."	2020	3	11	2020-03-11	"Spain"	"IrsiCaixa, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autrnoma de Barcelona (UAB), Badalona, Spain mmartinez@irsicaixa.es."

"background: a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) has infected more than 75 000 individuals and spread to over 20 countries. it is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung.methods: we have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight sars-cov-2 patients  25 community-acquired pneumonia (cap) patients  and 20 healthy controls.results: the median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in sars-cov-2 infected patients  which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. the distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). however  very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism  implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus  or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread  the risk should not be overlooked. the microbiota in sars-cov-2 infected patients was similar to those in cap  either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.conclusion: sars-cov-2 evolves in vivo after infection  which may affect its virulence  infectivity  and transmissibility. although how the intra-host variant spreads in the population is still elusive  it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes."	2020	3	5	2020-03-05	"China"	"National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mirieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp"	FALSE	FALSE

"background: a patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids  secretions  and excreta. the persistence and clearance of viral rna from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) remain unclear. this study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) rna in different samples from patients with covid-19  providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.methods: the clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with covid-19 who were admitted to from january 20  2020 to february 10  2020 were collected retrospectively. the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab  stool  urine  and serum samples were collected and analyzed. convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative rt-pcr results for viral rna from oropharyngeal swabs. the effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (cd4)+ t lymphocytes  inflammatory indicators  and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.results: in the 292 confirmed cases  66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. in total  28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. after in-hospital treatment  patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. the median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative rt-pcr results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. by february 10  2020  11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral rna from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-ncov following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. among these 55 patients  43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral rna than for throat swabs  with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral rna was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. using a multiple linear regression model (f<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.669  p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.044  and adjusted r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.122)  the analysis showed that the cd4+ t lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral rna detection in patients' stools (t<U+200A>=<U+200A>-2.699  p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.010). the duration of viral rna detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days  respectively; t<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.550  p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.013) and the duration of viral rna detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days  respectively; t<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.631  p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001). there was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral rna test results and those with negative results (p<U+200A>&gt;<U+200A>0.05).conclusions: in brief  as the clearance of viral rna in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs  it is important to identify viral rna in feces during convalescence. because of the delayed clearance of viral rna in the glucocorticoid treatment group  glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of covid-19  especially for mild disease. the duration of rna detection may relate to host cell immunity."	2020	3	3	2020-03-03	"China"	"Department of Pulmonology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."

"the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov) disease (covid-19) in china at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. as of 11 february 2020  data from the world health organization (who) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries regions  with &gt;99% of cases being detected in china. on 30 january 2020  the who declared covid-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. sars-cov-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses  bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21. it is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact  and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. among patients with pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or wuhan pneumonia)  fever was the most common symptom  followed by cough. bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. the one case of sars-cov-2 pneumonia in the usa is responding well to remdesivir  which is now undergoing a clinical trial in china. currently  controlling infection to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 is the primary intervention being used. however  public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely  as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak  the better we can respond."	2020	2	23	2020-02-23	"Taiwan"	"Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan"	FALSE	TRUE

(11) avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) for patients who need aerosol therapy  dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization."	2020	2	23	2020-02-23	NA	NA	FALSE	FALSE

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients  eight of whom had visited the huanan seafood market in wuhan. complete and partial 2019-ncov genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. viral contigs were connected using sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes  with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cdna ends. phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-ncov genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. homology modelling was done to

bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21  and was genetically distinct from sars-cov. notably  homology modelling revealed that 2019-ncov had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of sars-cov

"background: the initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov)-infected pneumonia (ncip) occurred in wuhan  hubei province  china  in december 2019 and january 2020. we analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of ncip.methods: we collected information on demographic characteristics  exposure history  and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of ncip that had been reported by january 22  2020. we described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. in the early period of exponential growth  we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.results: among the first 425 patients with confirmed ncip  the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. the majority of cases (55%) with onset before january 1  2020  were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market  as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [ci]  4.1 to 7.0)  with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. in its early stages  the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. with a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% ci  5.3 to 19)  the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% ci  1.4 to 3.9).conclusions: on the basis of this information  there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of december 2019. considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

(2) colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of covid-19 to patients and doctors. therefore  it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding  obstruction  gastrointestinal foreign bodies  etc.). if the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed covid-19  the surgeons must perform emergency surgery  and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) the colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices  and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 pa) must be separated. all disposable medical items  body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) the surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with covid-19 must be protected by three-level. after operation  the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days. we hope our &quot;renji experience&quot; will be beneficial to colleagues."	2020	3	21	2020-03-21	"China"	"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200127, China."

"to assess the effectiveness of response strategies of avoiding large gatherings or crowded areas and to predict the spread of covid-19 infections in japan  we developed a stochastic transmission model by extending the susceptible-infected-removed (sir) epidemiological model with an additional modeling of the individual action on whether to stay away from the crowded areas. the population were divided into three compartments: susceptible  infected  removed. susceptible transitions to infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of infected and the congestion of area. the total area consists of three zones crowded zone  mid zone and uncrowded zone  with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. the time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0  2  4  6  7  and 8 hours  and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. this simulation showed that the number of infected and removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. on the other hand  the stagnant growth of infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours  and the growth number of infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours. in conclusions the infection spread in japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the crowded zone to less than 4 hours."	2020	3	20	2020-03-20	"Japan"	"Department of Human and Engineered Environmental Studies, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Chiba, Japan."

"the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in japan was reported on 15 january 2020 and the number of reported cases has increased day by day. the purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for covid-19 in japan by using the real-time data from 15 january to 29 february 2020. taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective population  we apply the well-known seir compartmental model for the prediction. by using a least-square-based method with poisson noise  we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in japan is r 0 = 2 . 6 ( 95 % ci  2 . 4 - 2 . 8 ) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer. in addition  we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size."	2020	3	19	2020-03-19	"Japan"	"Graduate School of System Informatics, Kobe University, 1-1 Rokkodai-cho, Nada-ku, Kobe 657-8501, Japan."

"the outbreak of an epidemic disease may pose significant treats to human beings and may further lead to a global crisis. in order to control the spread of an epidemic  the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. however  no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks  which  if improperly treated  may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. therefore  this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks  which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. the application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in wuhan  china. even though the uncertainty of the future covid-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research  several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. among other insights  the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan  but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage  more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution."	2020	3	19	2020-03-19	"Norway"	"Department of Industrial Engineering, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Lodve Langesgate 2, 8514 Narvik, Norway."
